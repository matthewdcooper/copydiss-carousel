So far I have managed to use a shortcode hook that the plugin replaces with a carousel div, which is styled using the plugin's css. I have one image.

I still must: 

a) create an admin panel, which facilitates 

    - creation of new carousels
    - adding new images to the carousels (putting the images in the wp database)
    - changing the rotation speed of the carousel
    - showing the shortcode for adding the carousel to a Page
    - deletion of a carousel

b) use the shortcode id attribute to:

    - query a carousel's images from the database
    - query the carousel's rotation speed
    - iterate over images and create corresponding output
    - use the rotation speed value and add it as a hidden value to the form
    - from js, read rotation speed and use that
